Hey there! Welcome to this multi-part introduction to [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), a Javascript based framework to make some kickass websites.

The [Introduction To AngularJS](http://blog.aashni.me/2016/08/angularjs-an-introduction/) is the start of the tutorial and has all the juicy information that you're looking for!

I've broken down this tutorial into five sections that build on top of each other, and hope to add some more sections in the future.

I originally taught this as a virtual class as part of the [Ladies Storm Hackathons Tutorial](https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/Tutorials) series, and decided to convert it into a written tutorial for anyone looking to start learning AngularJS.
